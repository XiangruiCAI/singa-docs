    * [Release Notes 0.2.0](releases/RELEASE_NOTES_0.2.0.html)
    * New features and major updates,
        * [Training on GPU](docs/gpu.html) enables training of complex models on a single node with multiple GPU cards.
        * [Hybrid neural net partitioning](docs/hybrid.html) supports data and model parallelism at the same time.
        * [Python wrapper](docs/python.html) makes it easy to configure the job, including neural net and SGD algorithm.
        * [RNN model and BPTT algorithm](docs/general-rnn.html) are implemented to support applications based on RNN models, e.g., GRU.
        * [Cloud software integration](docs/distributed-training.html) includes Mesos, Docker and HDFS.
        * Visualization of neural net structure and layer information, which is helpful for debugging.
        * Linear algebra functions and random functions against Blobs and raw data pointers.
        * New layers, including SoftmaxLayer, ArgSortLayer, DummyLayer, RNN layers and cuDNN layers.
        * Update Layer class to carry multiple data/grad Blobs.
        * Extract features and test performance for new data by loading previously trained model parameters.
        * Add Store class for IO operations.
